# Kinetix - A simple enzyme kinetics simulation framework

This is a simple framework for single / multiple reaction enzyme kinetics simulation and plotting.
It allows one to plot reaction kinetics that follows the reversible [Michaelis - Menten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics) model.

## Usage
One can use the library to produce figures via a command line interface or programmatically (see below for examples)
